#  Vision Transformer  (Brain Tumor Detection)



Early, accurate classification of brain tumors—specifically glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors—is critical for determining treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Conventional methods using CNNs have achieved high accuracy, but Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in modeling global context and long-range dependencies, which are particularly beneficial in medical imaging .




##  Model Architecture & Preprocessing

Patch Generation: Split each input MRI image into non-overlapping patches (e.g., 16×16), embed each patch, and flatten to form token embeddings.

Classification Token: Insert an extra learnable [CLS] token used to capture global image-level representation for final classification via a Transformer encoder.

Training Details: Typically used 5‑fold cross-validation, tuning learning rate, batch size, and data augmentations to mitigate overfitting.


## Performance Results
Achieved Accuracy: 76.0% overall classification accuracy across glioma, meningioma, and pituitary classes (held-out test set).

Comparison with Literature:

Most published ViT methods on public datasets (e.g., Figshare with ~3,064 T1w CE MRI slices) report accuracies between 98.2% (single model) and 98.7% (model ensemble) 

Other works using transformers show accuracies ranging from 91–99%, depending on dataset size, preprocessing, ensemble use, or additional enhancements like cross-attention mechanisms or feature calibration modules 




## Discussion & Potential Improvements

Dataset Scale: Many benchmark results hinge on ~3K+ labeled images and extensive cross‑validation. Smaller datasets may explain lower accuracy.

Data Augmentation & Preprocessing: Techniques like histogram equalization, rotations, and advanced filters often boost generalization 


Model Enhancements: State-of-the-art approaches introduce modules like Selective Cross-Attention (SCA), Feature Calibration (FCM), or rotational invariance mechanisms—features that improve top-end performance 

Ensembling: Combining multiple ViT variants (e.g., B/16, B/32, L/16, L/32) often equates to accuracy gains of ~0.5% or more 



## Conclusions & Next Steps

Achieved a 76% accuracy ViT-based classification—an excellent baseline for a custom implementation.

To boost performance toward state-of-the-art (98%+), consider scaling training data, exploring augmentation, tuning hyperparameters, or integrating ensemble or enhanced attention modules.

Performing qualitative analysis (confusion matrix, misclassified cases) could further inform model weaknesses.
